                    Skills are essential in shaping a person's growth, abilities, and future aspirations. 
                    One of my strongest skills is coding, as I have experience in Python, Java, C#, and a bit of Arduino. 
                    I learned Python when I was in first year college, and it was my first programming language that I fully understood.
                    I find Java a bit confusing, but I can still manage to use it in different forms.
                    On the other hand, C# is my go-to programming language because I find it easy to learn.
                    These programming languages help me develop applications, solve technical problems, and even create automation for different tasks. 
                    I became interested in coding because of my studies, and I continue to improve by practicing and learning new techniques. 
                    Another skill I have is drawing portraits using traditional mediums, which allows me to express creativity through art. 
                    Drawing requires patience, attention to detail, and an understanding of proportions, all of which I developed through years of practice.

                </div>

                    Additionally, I have a strong foundation in news writing, which I have been doing since grade 4. 
                    Writing news articles has improved my ability to analyze information, organize thoughts, and communicate effectively. 
                    My experience as a senior writer for The UE Dawn further honed my journalism skills, particularly in covering sports events. 
                    Writing has also helped me become more observant and critical of details, which is useful in many aspects of life. 
                    These skills, whether technical, artistic, or literary, contribute to my personal and academic growth. 
                    They also provide me with valuable tools that I can use in different career paths. 
                    Coding opens opportunities in software development and technology, while drawing allows me to express emotions and ideas. 
                    Writing, on the other hand, helps me convey information, document events, and share perspectives with others. 
                    By continuously improving my skills, I aim to become more versatile and knowledgeable in different fields. 
                    Learning new techniques in programming, experimenting with different art styles, and refining my writing are part of my ongoing journey. 
                    My skills serve as a foundation for my passions and future goals, pushing me to keep improving and exploring new opportunities.

                    Interests drive a person’s curiosity and motivation to explore new things. 
                    One of my biggest interests is robotics, particularly learning to build robots with Arduino. 
                    I have worked with Arduino before for research projects, and I want to expand my knowledge by applying it to robotics. 
                    Understanding how machines work and programming them to perform tasks is something I find fascinating. 
                    Another interest of mine is making a film, as I want to combine storytelling with visual creativity. 
                    Creating a film requires imagination, technical skills, and teamwork, which are all aspects I want to explore. 
                    I also have a growing interest in learning more about Sherlock Holmes, as his stories captivate me with their depth and intelligence. 
                    His methods of observation and deduction inspire me to be more analytical in real life. 
                    In addition, I recently developed an interest in reading books, as I started this habit just two months ago. 
                    Reading opens my mind to different perspectives, cultures, and ideas, making it an enriching experience. 
                    Another personal interest is collecting Pokémon and One Piece cards, which brings excitement and nostalgia. 
                    Collecting these cards connects me with a community of enthusiasts who share the same passion. 
                    I also have a strong curiosity about fixing electronic devices, as I enjoy understanding how things work and repairing them when they break. 
                    Fixing electronics requires patience, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail, which I am eager to develop further. 
                    My interests push me to continue learning, experimenting, and challenging myself. 
                    They give me new goals to achieve and motivate me to explore different areas of knowledge. 
                    I believe that having interests is important because they fuel curiosity and personal growth. 
                    Whether it's robotics, filmmaking, reading, collecting, or repairing devices, each interest contributes to my overall development. 
                    I hope to turn some of these interests into lifelong skills or even career opportunities in the future. 
                    Pursuing my interests allows me to discover new passions, improve my abilities, and expand my horizons.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Hobbies are an essential part of my life, helping me relax, entertain myself, and sharpen my mind. 
                    I enjoy playing <abbr title='Defense Of The Ancients'><cite>DOTA 2</cite></abbr> and <cite>Tekken 7</cite>, as they require strategic thinking, fast decision-making, and adaptability. 
                    I often play with my friends to spend time with them.
                    It also helps me feel relaxed and calm whenever I play.
                    These competitive games challenge my reflexes and ability to think ahead, making them both enjoyable and mentally stimulating. 
                    Aside from gaming, I also love spending time with friends, as social interactions help me unwind and strengthen my relationships. 
                    Another hobby I deeply enjoy is reading mystery books, especially Sherlock Holmes stories, because they enhance my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. 
                    The thrill of solving mysteries and uncovering hidden clues keeps me engaged in the story. 
                    Watching Detective Conan helped me discover the fun in reading <cite>Sherlock Holmes</cite>. 
                    Arthur Conan Doyle really brings the best stories about <cite>Sherlock Holmes</cite>.
                    This love for detective stories extends to watching <cite>Sherlock Holmes</cite> movies, where I appreciate the brilliant deductions and suspenseful storytelling. 
                    I also have a strong interest in Japanese literature, both in written and visual formats, as they offer unique storytelling styles and cultural perspectives. 
                    My hobbies also include playing intellectual games like chess and shogi, which train my patience, logical thinking, and strategic planning. 
                    Chess helps me develop foresight, while shogi introduces me to different tactical approaches. 
                    These hobbies not only entertain me but also provide mental challenges that keep me sharp. 
                    Through gaming, reading, and playing strategy games, I maintain a balance between relaxation and intellectual stimulation. 
                    My hobbies give me a way to escape from stress while still learning and improving various skills. 
                    They also allow me to connect with others who share similar interests, creating opportunities for discussions and friendly competition. 
                    I believe hobbies should be both enjoyable and beneficial, helping a person grow in different aspects of life. 
                    By engaging in these activities, I continue to develop my critical thinking, social connections, and creativity.
